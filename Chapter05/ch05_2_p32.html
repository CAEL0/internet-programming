                My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name
                Philip, my infant ongue could make of both names nothing longer
                or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to
                be called Pip.

                Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the
                river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and
                broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have
                been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. ....

                "Hold your nois!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up
                from among the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep
                still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat!"

                A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg.
                A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag
                tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and
                smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and
                stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered,
                and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head
                as he seized me by the chin.
